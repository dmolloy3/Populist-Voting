# Populist Voting

This page contains code and graphs from my thesis on generational populist voting. There is some explanation for these graphs, but it is obviously a heavily reduced version of my actual thesis. 

The .md file shows the rendered graphs, while the .rmd file shows the source code for these graphs. Finally, Thesis.pdf is a copy of my full thesis.
